The main goals of this project are to:
- Understand user movement through the website
- Identify **drop-off points** after the first visit
- Compare **channel-wise engagement performance**
- Identify high-quality traffic sources
- Provide **data-driven recommendations** to improve engagement

The dataset is based on **web analytics data** and includes fields such as:
- `fullVisitorId` – Unique visitor identifier
- `sessionId` – Session identifier
- `visitNumber` – Number of visits by a user
- `channelGrouping` – Traffic source (Organic, Direct, Paid, etc.)
- `date` – Visit date

## 🛠 Tools Used
